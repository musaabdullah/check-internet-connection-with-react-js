# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### Deployment

### `npm run build` fails to minify
